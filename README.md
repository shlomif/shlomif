Hi there and Shalom!

I am a 5 May 1977-born [Tel Aviv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv)-based
Israeli software developer and Internet writer,
entertainer / educator / amateur philosopher. Shlomi Fish is
[my real and legal name](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml),
but I am also known as ["Rindolf"](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/).

I consider myself a [Hacker Monarch](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs),
which is what I call "a messiah", a world savior, keeper of the faith, etc.
and recommend every man, woman, of any age, to follow suit.
["I am my brothers' keeper."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel).

My current (2021) mid-term objective is to ["Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as 2021 geek/hacker imperatives for revitalising the film industry"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/) or **Promoting Commercial Fanfiction** for short.
